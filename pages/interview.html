<p>Interview  with Nick Shaw – NickBass Lessons<br />
  <br />
  -Do  you have a website?<br />
  No<br />
  <br />
  -Have  you thought about getting a website for yourself?<br />
  Actually  yes, I got the idea from a friend of my dad’s, who is a bassist for hire at  Berklee College of Music<br />
  <br />
  -Who  is the target audience for your website?<br />
  Generally,  people who want bass lessons, but a lot of the students I have are kids whose  parents want them to take lessons. Other people who I would want to come to my  site are people who are looking for a bassist for recording sessions<br />
  <br />
  -Do  you have a logo you can use?<br />
  No<br />
  <br />
  -Is  there a specific color scheme you would like to use?<br />
  Nothing  in particular, but if I had to choose probably a darker color scheme. Something  nice on the eyes but not too dark.<br />
  <br />
  -Do  you have any competitors?<br />
  No,  not really, a lot of the people around the area teach guitar.<br />
  <br />
  -Do  you have a budget?<br />
  Not  really but if I like what I see, I can figure something out.</p>
<p>  -Are  there any particular things you want on the site?<br />
  What  I want are a few YouTube Videos and Soundcloud files of me playing bass to show  the variety of styles that I can teach. For those who want to know a page  describing my setup when I play bass. Lastly, since I want to branch out with  my lessons, transcriptions of the lessons.<br />
  <br />
  -How  would you want to have your students pay for lessons? (Online/Check/Cash by  Mail)<br />
  If  the students are local, preferably cash, but since I want to branch to a wider  area I would accept PayPal payments?<br />
  <br />
  -How  often will the site be updated?<br />
  At  least once a week, magic doesn’t come to overnight when it comes to thinking of  lessons.</p>
